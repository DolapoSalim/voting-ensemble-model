# voting-ensemble-model

This repo contains an ensemble model
See the ensemble model as a scenario where you have a bidding/auction, and the product or antique to be sold goes to the highest bidder. The ensemble model works similarly where we use multiple machine learning models to make better predictions on a dataset. An ensemble.

In this repo, I used a Voting classifier, where the ensemble models predict by ascertaining from the majority vote.
